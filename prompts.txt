I am trying to add a button to the prompt builder page that will take a generated prompt and submit it to OpenAIApi, then display the response in a user friendly way inline on the page. I want you to do the following:

Research deeply across my codebase
Find what files and functions are related to the problems and goals I outlined above
Assess reasons for why the feature might not be working or why it might not work. If I am asking for something impossible or a task you do not have the tools to accomplish, let me know.
Develop a plan to fix it
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All database operations must use the Neon database(ep-old-fog). NEVER use the Replit database.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Do not implement fallback data or graceful fallbacks. All data issues must be fixed at the source.
Write this entire plan and report into a file called "Instructions.md" in my project


I want you to implement Open AI Api integration on the prompt builder page. Before you begin, please carefully read and adhere to the plan and insights found in the "Instructions.md" file and follow those instructions. If there is something in those Instructions that might stop you, let me know and guide me on how to unblock you.

CRITICAL: Use ONLY the Neon database(ep-old-fog). Do not use the Replit database under any circumstances.

CRITICAL: Do not implement fallback data. All data mapping issues must be resolved properly.
